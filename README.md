# Development Environment

This application was developed using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

The programming language used to create this program was Python. It was configured with the Arcade library.

# Useful Websites

Here are a few websites which helped me understand how to utilize the Arcade library for Python:

* [The Python Arcade Library (Documentation)](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
* [Python Arcade - Basic Concepts (Tutorial Series)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP6KYkkXj-QbBP0He1Ot5wGgtPbR9hqxR)

# Future Work

While the application is functional, in the future I'd like to expand the capabilities of the game. This will include:

* Allow the game to load a puzzle (both incomplete and its solution)
* Allow the game to save a puzzle (again, both incomplete and its solution)
* Make playing Sudoku possible for the user, not just solving a puzzle
