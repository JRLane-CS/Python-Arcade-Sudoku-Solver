# Python Arcade Sudoku Solver

## Overview
The Python Arcade Sudoku Solver is an application which permits a user to input numbers into a 7 X 7 grid. Upon clicking the "Solve" button, the program will iterate through possible solutions until it either finds one or determines the puzzle cannot be solved.

## Description

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

## Purpose

Over the years, I have worked on many, many Sudoku puzzles. Too often, I have been unable to solve them, particularly those deemed 'difficult' or 'impossible'. I decided to code this application to let me input a puzzle, work on it until I determined I could not solve it, and then run this to see what the solution might look like. I could also use it to give myself a hint, if needed. 

## Demo Video

The following is a video demonstration of the application functioning and a code walkthrough:

# Development Environment

This application was developed using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

The programming language used to create this program was Python. It was configured with the Arcade library.

# Useful Websites

Here are a few websites which helped me understand how to utilize the Arcade library for Python:

# Future Work

While the application is functional, in the future I'd like to expand the capabilities of the game. This will include:

* Allow the game to load a puzzle (both incomplete and its solution)
* Allow the game to save a puzzle (again, both incomplete and its solution)
* Make playing Sudoku possible for the user, not just solving a puzzle
* Create the ability to get hints regardless of whether the user plays it as a game or by inputting the puzzle insofar as he or she has 'solved' it and letting the game show the number which should go into a 'blank' space
